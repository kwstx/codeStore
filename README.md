# Engram

**The gateway to code memory.**

Engram is a local-first VS Code extension that creates a semantic index of your codebase, allows for instant context retrieval, and keeps your flow state unbroken. It acts as a privacy-first "smart memory" for your development workflow.

## Core Capabilities

### Prompt Tracker & Context Memory
Visualize your thought process. Engram tracks and versions prompt iterations, helping you understand the "why" behind your code changes.
*   **Automatic indexing** of prompts and intent.
*   **Searchable history** of your coding decisions.

### Mistake Shield
Fingerprint your errors. Engram remembers what broke previously so you don't repeat the same mistakes.
*   **Active warning system** when you are about to repeat a known bad pattern.
*   **Confidence Control**: Toggle between "Breeze" (Quiet) and "Strict" (Audible) sensitivity modes.

### Smart Recall
Cross-tool memory. Automatically link pasted code back to its original prompt.
*   **Instant context** for pasted snippets.
*   **Pattern matching** to find similar solutions in your history.

### Security Vibe Check
Real-time scanning. Catch secrets and risky patterns before they run.
*   **Inline warnings** for dangerous patterns (secrets, eval).
*   **Context Aware**: Intelligently ignores comments and string literals to reduce noise.
*   **Informed Overrides**: Dismiss warnings with a reason.

### Contextual Memory Cards
"Explain the Warning." Engram turns generic error messages into personalized history lessons.
*   **Historical Context**: Hover over a warning to see *when* you last encountered it.
*   **AI Diff Analysis**: Explains *how* you fixed similar errors previously ("Replaced X with Y").
*   **Action Tracking**: Reminds you of past fixes.

## Privacy First
**100% Local Processing.**
Your code and patterns never leave your machine. Engram uses local logic and storage to ensure total privacy.

## Quick Start

1.  **Install** the extension.
2.  **Start coding!** Engram indexes your workflow in the background.
3.  **Check the Status Bar**: Click the Shield icon to toggle Sensitivity (Breeze/Strict).
4.  **Hover over warnings** to see Memory Cards and AI Analysis.
